# Installation
Head to the [release page](https://github.com/lowkangxuan/decorator-volume-tool/releases) to install the latest version of the tool.
You get the option to install the entire source code that contains an example project and the plugin itself, or you can choose to install only the plugin which you can then use in any of your other unreal projects.

# Usage
To make use of the tool itself, you will have to place a `Decorator Volume` actor into your level, assign a `Decorator Palette` to the volume actor and tweak the parameters available to your ideal look and feel.
