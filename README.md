# Installation
Head to the [release page](https://github.com/lowkangxuan/decorator-volume-tool/releases) to install the latest version of the tool. You can choose to download the plugin only or the plugin + an example project which I have put together to showcase the tool's capabilities and how you can replicate it within your own game levels.

# Usage
Using the volume is extremely easy. All you need is to place a "Decorator Volume" into your level and assigning a "Decorator Palette" of your choice.
