# Installation
Head to the [release page](https://github.com/lowkangxuan/decorator-volume-tool/releases) to install the latest version of the tool.
You get the option to install an example project thaat includes the plugin itself, or you can choose to install only the plugin which you can then use in any of your other unreal projects.

## Adding the plugin to your project
After downloading the plugin, head to your project directory (where your `.uproject` file located), create a folder named `Plugins` (if it does not exist already), and place the tool's plugin folder in there.

Once done, open your project and open the plugins window (`Edit -> Plugins`). Under the `Installed` section, select `Projector Tool`, enable the plugin by ensuring the checkbox is checked, and restart the project.

When the above steps are done properly, the tool should be usable in your project.

# Usage
To make use of the tool itself, you will have to place a `Decorator Volume` actor into your level, assign a `Decorator Palette` to the volume actor and tweak the parameters available to your ideal look and feel.

## Creating a volume and palette
Right click the content browser, go to the "Decorator Volume" category, and you can choose to create either a `Volume` or `Palette`<br>
